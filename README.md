# SMS-Spam-Detection
An ML-based SMS Spam Classifier model which classifies SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (not spam). <br>
● The model was developed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm with TFIDF vectorization. <br>
● Goal was to minimize the number of false positives and the model had 95% accuracy and 100% precision score. <br>
● The accuracy was then improved from 95% to 97% by making changes in TFIDF vectorization. <br>
● Technology used: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Cleaning, Streamlit. <br>
